\description{
Fit a Weibull upper tail to the sample X and estimate quantiles
}
\details{
The serial dependence coefficient r11 can be a positive number, or a list 
  produced by R11.R. 
  
  In case a quantile is to be estimated for a \emph{frequency} f, and 
  \enumerate{
  \item{if X contains all values (possibly above some threshold), then with
  EI an estimate of the Extremal Index from EI.R, set
  p = f*d/EI and N = T/d, with T the length of the observation period and d the time step. 
        Note that f and d are defined with reference to the same unit of time!! In this case,
        r11 needs to be estimated.
      }
  \item{if X contains only the n (approximately Poisson) peak values above some threshold 
        (in a PoT analysis),  it is recommended to set r11= 1 and take p = f*d and 
        N = T/d*EI. EI need to be estimated (see above). In this case, EI can also be 
        estimated also as EI= n*d/Tt= n/nt with Tt the time spent above the threshold and 
        nt the number of time-series values above the threshold. 
       } 
} 
 metadata may contain the following fields (in addition to your own meta data):
 \itemize{
  \item{$varname: variable name}
  \item{$varunit: physical unit of variable}
  \item{$timeunit: time unit (e.g. year)}
  \item{$timestep: time step in units of timeunit}
  \item{$timelength: length of time covered by time-series, in units of timeunit} 
  \item{$EI: extremal index (see above)}
  \item{$nexcess (for PoT only): no. of data values (as opposed to peak values) exceeding the threshold}
 }
